# Fmood, the Diatry

Fmood, the Diatry was created to help users bring mindfulness to how the food they eat affects their mood! <br>
This project utilized two API's as well as JavaScript to add dynamic interactivity that the user can utilize to gather nutritional facts and information about food. Here is the link to the deployed project [here](https://google.com) **link is just a placeholder** <!-- Add actual deployed link -->


## User Story

- I want an application where I can log what I am eating
- This should happen when what I have eaten is timestamped
- Then I want to be able to write/rate how I feel/felt about the meal
- So I can reflect on how my food choices relate to my mood.


## Installation 

N/A


## Usage

Fmood is a digital webpage that allows a user to log their eating habits, along with introspective commentary of their feelings about the meal they logged. You can request nutrition facts if you have ever wondered how many calories were in the apple you just ate, or your entire 4 course meal! By clicking 'Log Your Meal' a user can input their meal, how they felt before, and how they felt after. Their information will be saved to local storage and remain until the next time they log a meal.

## Project Status

This project is and will continue being fine-tuned until we reach our original vision of creating a safe space where someone can learn how to be mindful about their eating habits, and hopefully develop new, healthy ones!!
